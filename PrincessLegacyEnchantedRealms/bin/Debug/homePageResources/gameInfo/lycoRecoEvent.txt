Welcome to Lycoris Recoil - the ultimate action-packed event where you get to experience the world of Takina Inoue and her fellow Lycoris assassins! In this event, you will be transported to Tokyo, where you'll join Takina on her quest to save Japan from terrorists led by Majima.

As a member of the Lycoris team, you will be disguised as a high school student and tasked with eliminating criminals and terrorists while maintaining peace in Japan. You'll need to use your sharpshooting skills and quick reflexes to take down the bad guys and protect your fellow Lycoris agents.

With an array of weapons at your disposal, including rifles, pistols, and grenades, you'll be able to customize your loadout to suit your playstyle. And with the ability to play as Takina or Chisato Nishikigi, you can switch up your strategy at any time.

But that's not all - in Lycoris Recoil, you'll also have the opportunity to manage a caf√© called "LycoReco" with Chisato, all while working towards reinstatement with the Lycoris agency. It's a race against time as the peace of Japan hangs in the balance!

So, what are you waiting for? Join Takina and the Lycoris team in Lycoris Recoil and show the terrorists who's boss!
